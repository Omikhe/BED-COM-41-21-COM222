1. Create a view of employees who manage houses, which shows the branch they work at, their staff number, and the number of houses they manage:

```sql
CREATE VIEW employees_managing_houses AS
SELECT b.branchNo, s.staffNo, COUNT(p.PropertyNo) AS houses_managed
FROM Staff s
JOIN Branch b ON s.branchNo = b.branchNo
LEFT JOIN PropertyForRent p ON s.staffNo = p.staffNo
WHERE p.type = 'House'
GROUP BY b.branchNo, s.staffNo;
```

2. Create a view 'View_Months' to display all the properties viewed after the end of March and before the beginning of June at BranchNo B003:

```sql
CREATE VIEW View_Months AS
SELECT p.PropertyNo, p.street, p.city, v.viewDate
FROM PropertyForRent p
JOIN Viewing v ON p.PropertyNo = v.PropertyNo
JOIN Registration r ON v.clientNo = r.clientNo
WHERE r.branchNo = 'B003' AND v.viewDate >= '2004-04-01' AND v.viewDate < '2004-06-01';
```

3. Create a virtual table 'June_Viewings' to display different properties that were viewed in the month of May 2004:

```sql
CREATE VIEW June_Viewings AS
SELECT DISTINCT p.PropertyNo, p.street, p.city
FROM PropertyForRent p
JOIN Viewing v ON p.PropertyNo = v.PropertyNo
WHERE v.viewDate BETWEEN '2004-05-01' AND '2004-05-31';
```

4. Create a view Employee_1 to count the number of properties managed by each member of staff at branch office B003:

```sql
CREATE VIEW Employee_1 AS
SELECT s.staffNo, s.fName, s.lName, COUNT(p.PropertyNo) AS properties_managed
FROM Staff s
LEFT JOIN PropertyForRent p ON s.staffNo = p.staffNo
WHERE s.branchNo = 'B003'
GROUP BY s.staffNo, s.fName, s.lName;
```

5. Create a view to display the properties that are managed by employees who work in the branch at 163 Main Street:

```sql
CREATE VIEW properties_managed_at_main_street AS
SELECT p.PropertyNo, p.street, p.city, s.fName, s.lName
FROM PropertyForRent p
JOIN Staff s ON p.staffNo = s.staffNo
JOIN Branch b ON s.branchNo = b.branchNo
WHERE b.street = '163 Main St';
```

6. Create a virtual table 'Property_or_Branch_office' to display all cities where there is either a property or branch office:

```sql
CREATE VIEW Property_or_Branch_office AS
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM (
  SELECT city FROM Branch
  UNION
  SELECT city FROM PropertyForRent
) combined_cities;
```
